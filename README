Description:

Add epg info from epg sources into vdr. xmltv2vdr just imports data in
xmltv format which must be provided by an external source (wich is not
part of this package)

Interface for sources:

All sources must provide a control file with a name similar to the
name of the source/source.xmltv (e.g. epgdata.xmltv -> epgdata).
In the first line you can decide if your source provides data by file 
(file must be placed in /var/lib/epgsources with extension .xmltv) or
pipe (binary with the same name is called by xmltv2vdr-plugin, and
must be in the path), the second line shows the days which will be
read by the plugin, followed by the maximum days which will be provided.
The next lines are unique channelnames, provided by the source.
There can be application dependend data after each channelname. Note,
that the plugin/VDR must be able to change this control file (channels
will be marked with an asterisk if choosen in the setup).

See this link for an list of unique channelnames (and please report
if there should be more)
